# AMLS_21-22_SN18014580

## Introduction to the assignment

This is the GitHub repository created by *STUDENT NUMBER 18014580* for the 2021/22 ELEC0134 Applied Machine Learning Systems final coding assignment. This repository is made up of 3 files/scripts that are used for Task A and B respectively. 

For this assignment we are given an initial data set containing 3000 512-x-512 images of MRI scans for brain tumours and are also given a `.csv` file containing labels indicating the type of tumour for each of the 3000 images. We are later given a similar unseen testing set, only made available a week before the deadline for validation purposes.

In the assignment, we are required to build classifiers which perform image classification on the datasets given. These classification tasks can be split into Tasks A and B as described below:

* In Task A, we are required to to determine from the image if there is a tumour present or not, hence this is a binary classification problem.
* In Task B, we are required to determine the type of the tumour if one is present, rather than just determining if a tumour is present or not. Hence, this is a multiclass classification problem.

## Repository structure

This repositiory is made of 3 main files/scripts used for Tasks A and B respectively. The detailed breakdown of these main files is given below:

* `Task A using Logistic Regression.ipynb` is used to run the binary classifier for Task A using the Logistic Regression model.
* `Task A using SVM.ipynb` is used to ...
* `Task B using SVM.ipynb` is used to ...

A breakdown of the other folders and files in the repository is also given below:

* READme.md is this file
* dataset
* test


## Packages required

Many of the scripts require the same packages and in this section, we highlight each of the packages.

* `pandas` is required ...
