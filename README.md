This is the GitHub repository created by *STUDENT NUMBER 18014580* for the 2021/22 ELEC0134 Applied Machine Learning Systems final coding assignment. This repository is made up of 3 files/scripts that are used for Task A and B respectively. 

For this assignment we are given an initial data set containing 3000 512-x-512 images of MRI scans for brain tumours and are also given a `.csv` file containing labels indicating the type of tumour for each of the 3000 images. We are later given a similar unseen testing set, only made available a week before the deadline for validation purposes.

In the assignment, we are required to build classifiers which perform image classification on the datasets given. In Task A, we are required to perform binary classification meaning that

The detailed breakdown of the file structure is given below:
